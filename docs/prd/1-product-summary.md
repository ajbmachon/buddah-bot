# 1) Product Summary

**What**: A lightweight chat application where authenticated users interact with **Hermes 4** (405B default, 70B optional) using a proven spiritual wisdom prompt. Three conversation modes support different use cases.

**Why**: The prompt works beautifully on Nous Portal, but it's too technical for non-technical friends/family. BuddhaBot makes it accessible with simple login and clean chat interface.

**For whom**: Friends, family, and personal circle seeking spiritual guidance.

**Not commercial**: No monetization, no growth targets, no analytics dashboards. Just testing and sharing with trusted circle.

**Non-goals**: No RAG, no complex user management, no billing, no custom UI components. Keep it simple.
