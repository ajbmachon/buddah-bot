# 13) Design Philosophy

**Ship Fast, Learn Fast:**
- Start with Mode 1 only
- Add Google OAuth first (Email optional)
- Use Assistance UI defaults (no custom UI)
- Deploy early, iterate based on real use

**Constraints as Features:**
- No user management UI → manual account handling keeps it simple
- No analytics → trust your intuition and user feedback
- No monetization → freedom to experiment

**Quality Over Features:**
- Perfect the panel prompt experience first
- Add other modes only if users want them
- Keep UI minimal and distraction-free
