## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] All previous compatibility requirements maintained (Epics 1-3)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Initial users encounter critical bugs or poor experience

**Mitigation:**
- Thorough testing of error states before launch
- PRD checklist validation ensures completeness

- Have support channel ready for immediate feedback
- Monitor Vercel logs closely in first 48 hours

**Rollback Plan:**
- If critical issues found, temporarily disable new user access
- Fix issues and re-invite users with apology and explanation
- Vercel allows instant rollback to previous deployment if needed
