# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This is an excellent foundation implementation that significantly exceeds story requirements.
  The Assistant UI CLI has generated a production-quality starter template with comprehensive
  features including sidebar navigation, thread management, and full shadcn/ui integration.

  Code quality is exceptional with proper TypeScript configuration, clean component architecture,
  and adherence to all coding standards. The only blocking issue is the missing Git commit
  required by AC6. The Tailwind version mismatch is a strategic decision requiring team input.

  Once the Git commit is created, this story is ready for Done status. Tailwind CSS v4 has
  been accepted and tech stack documentation updated accordingly.
