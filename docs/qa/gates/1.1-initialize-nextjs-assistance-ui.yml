# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This is an excellent foundation implementation that significantly exceeds story requirements.
  The Assistant UI CLI has generated a production-quality starter template with comprehensive
  features including sidebar navigation, thread management, and full shadcn/ui integration.

  Code quality is exceptional with proper TypeScript configuration, clean component architecture,
  and adherence to all coding standards. All acceptance criteria have been met, including the
  initial Git commit (5d0064b). Tailwind CSS v4 has been accepted and tech stack documentation
  updated accordingly.

  Story is READY FOR DONE status. No blocking issues remain.
