# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This story implements authentication middleware correctly with strong security patterns.

  Key Findings:
  - All 5 acceptance criteria have clear implementations
  - Security validation follows "auth first" pattern from coding standards
  - Dual-layer protection (middleware + API validation) provides defense in depth
  - Code quality is clean with good separation of concerns

  Refactoring Applied:
  - Added explicit Edge runtime export to chat API (coding-standards.md compliance)

  Testing Approach:
  - Manual testing strategy appropriate for 2-day MVP with trusted user circle
  - Comprehensive checklist provided in Task 5
  - No automated tests required per testing-strategy.md

  Gate Decision: PASS
  - No blocking issues
  - Security patterns correct
  - Standards compliant
  - Ready for user validation
