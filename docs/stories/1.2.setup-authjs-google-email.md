## Dev Notes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Auth.js Version:**
- **Version:** 5.0.0-beta (production-ready beta)
- **Install:** `npm install next-auth@beta`
- **Breaking changes from v4:** New cookie names, import paths
- **Why beta:** Stable enough for greenfield project, v5 stable not yet released

**Email Provider Options:**
- **Resend (Recommended):** Simple API, generous free tier, built-in Auth.js support
- **SMTP (Alternative):** Any SMTP provider (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)

### Backend Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Centralized Auth Configuration:**
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google";
import Resend from "next-auth/providers/resend";

export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    Google({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET!,
    }),
    Resend({
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM || "noreply@yourdomain.com",
    }),
  ],
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
    maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
  },
  pages: {
    signIn: "/login",
    error: "/auth/error",
  },
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, user }) {
      if (user) {
        token.id = user.id;
      }
      return token;
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      if (token && session.user) {
        session.user.id = token.sub!;
      }
      return session;
    },
  },
});
```

**API Route Handler:**
```typescript
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { handlers } from "@/lib/auth";

export const { GET, POST } = handlers;
```

**Key Patterns:**
- **JWT Sessions:** No database needed, sessions stored in httpOnly cookies
- **Dual Providers:** Google OAuth (primary) + Email magic links (fallback)
- **Centralized Config:** Single source of truth in `lib/auth.ts`
- **Custom Pages:** Login at `/login`, errors at `/auth/error`

### Project Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Files to Create:**
```
app/
├── (auth)/
│   ├── login/
│   │   └── page.tsx             # Custom login page
│   └── auth/
│       └── error/
│           └── page.tsx         # Auth error page
├── api/
│   └── auth/
│       └── [...nextauth]/
│           └── route.ts         # Auth.js handler
├── layout.tsx                   # Update with SessionProvider
└── globals.css                  # (already exists)

components/
└── auth/
    └── SessionProvider.tsx      # Client SessionProvider wrapper

lib/
└── auth.ts                      # Centralized auth config
```

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Session Validation:** Always validate sessions in protected routes (Story 1.3)
2. **Client Components:** Login page must use `"use client"` directive for `signIn()`
3. **Error Handling:** Handle auth errors gracefully (network, user cancellation, invalid email)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Components: `SessionProvider.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`
- API Routes: `route.ts` (lowercase)
- Functions: `signIn()`, `signOut()`, `auth()`

### Environment Variables Setup

**Required Variables:**
```bash
# Auth.js Core
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=                          # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# Google OAuth
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=

# Email Provider (Option 1: Resend - Recommended)
RESEND_API_KEY=
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Email Provider (Option 2: SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Google OAuth Setup Instructions:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create new project: "BuddahBot"
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
5. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env.local`

**Resend Setup Instructions:**
1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com/)
2. Verify domain or use Resend's test domain
3. Create API key in dashboard
4. Copy API key to `.env.local` as `RESEND_API_KEY`
5. Set `EMAIL_FROM` to verified email address

### Frontend Architecture Notes
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Login Page Implementation:**
- Use Tailwind for styling (centered card, responsive)
- Add BuddahBot branding (logo, tagline)
- Loading states for auth actions (button disabled, spinner)
- Error messages displayed inline

**SessionProvider Pattern:**
```typescript
// components/auth/SessionProvider.tsx
"use client";

import { SessionProvider as NextAuthSessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

export function SessionProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <NextAuthSessionProvider>{children}</NextAuthSessionProvider>;
}
```

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx (update)
import { SessionProvider } from "@/components/auth/SessionProvider";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <SessionProvider>
          {children}
        </SessionProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Important Notes from Previous Stories

**Story 1.1 Completion Notes:**
- Next.js project initialized with App Router and TypeScript
- Assistance UI installed and configured
- Basic chat page created at `app/(chat)/page.tsx`
- Placeholder `/api/chat` route exists (returns 200)
- Project structure follows route group pattern

**Integration Points:**
- Chat page (`app/(chat)/page.tsx`) will be protected in Story 1.3
- `/api/chat` route will add session validation in Story 1.3
- Root layout already exists - update it to add SessionProvider

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

**Google OAuth Flow:**
- [ ] Navigate to `/login` - page loads with Google button
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google" - redirected to Google consent screen
- [ ] Grant permissions - redirected back to app with session created
- [ ] Verify session cookie exists in browser DevTools (Application tab)
- [ ] Refresh page - session persists (not logged out)
- [ ] Check Vercel logs - no errors during OAuth flow

**Email Magic Link Flow:**
- [ ] Navigate to `/login` - page loads with email input
- [ ] Enter valid email and submit - success message displayed
- [ ] Check email inbox - magic link email received
- [ ] Click magic link - redirected to app with session created
- [ ] Verify session cookie exists
- [ ] Refresh page - session persists

**Session Access:**
- [ ] Test `useSession()` in client component - returns session data
- [ ] Test `auth()` in server component - returns session data
- [ ] Test `auth()` in API route - returns session data
- [ ] Sign out - session cleared, cookie removed

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Test invalid email format - error message displayed
- [ ] Test Google OAuth cancellation - redirected to error page
- [ ] Test expired magic link - error page displays helpful message

**Environment Variables:**
- [ ] Verify all required env vars are set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Verify `.env.local.example` has complete documentation
- [ ] Test without env vars - app fails gracefully with clear error

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment

**Auto-escalation Triggered:** YES
- ✓ Authentication/security files touched (critical path)
- ✓ No automated tests added (manual testing strategy applied)
- ✓ Story has 7 acceptance criteria (>5 threshold)

**Risk Category:** HIGH (Authentication is critical security boundary)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** STRONG implementation with clean architecture

**Strengths:**
- Centralized authentication configuration follows documented architecture exactly
- Clean separation of concerns (auth logic, UI, API routes)
- Proper use of client/server boundaries with "use client" directives
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Excellent Suspense boundary implementation (fixed from prior build error)
- Loading states prevent double submissions
- JWT session strategy correctly implemented (httpOnly cookies, 30-day expiration)

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✓ Follows centralized auth pattern from backend-architecture.md
- ✓ Dual provider setup (Google OAuth + Resend email)
- ✓ JWT sessions with no database requirement
- ✓ Custom pages configured at /login and /auth/error
- ✓ SessionProvider properly wrapped in root layout

### Refactoring Performed

**1. Enhanced Environment Variable Validation (lib/auth.ts:5-34)**
   - **Change:** Added `validateAuthEnv()` function with build-aware validation
   - **Why:** Original code used non-null assertions (!) which could cause runtime crashes with poor error messages if env vars missing
   - **How:**
     - Validates required env vars at module load time
     - Fails fast with clear, actionable error message
     - Skips validation during build phase (NEXT_PHASE check) to allow CI/CD
     - Lists all missing variables in error message
   - **Impact:** Security improvement - prevents silent failures, improves debuggability

### Compliance Check

**Coding Standards (docs/architecture/coding-standards.md):**
- ✓ **Critical Rule 1 (System Prompts):** N/A - no prompts in auth
- ✓ **Critical Rule 2 (Streaming/Edge Runtime):** N/A - auth uses Node runtime appropriately
- ✓ **Critical Rule 3 (Session Validation):** Will be validated in Story 1.3 (protected routes)
- ✓ **Critical Rule 4 (Assistance UI):** N/A - login page is custom by design
- ✓ **Naming Conventions:** PascalCase components, camelCase functions, lowercase routes
- ✓ **File Organization:** Imports ordered, hooks first, clean structure

**Project Structure (docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md):**
- ✓ Files created in correct locations per route group pattern
- ✓ `(auth)` route group properly used for login/error pages
- ✓ API routes at `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`
- ✓ Centralized config at `lib/auth.ts`

**Testing Strategy (docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md):**
- ✓ **Philosophy:** Manual testing for MVP - ACCEPTABLE per project guidelines
- ✗ **Execution:** Manual testing checklist provided but NOT YET PERFORMED
- ✓ **Documentation:** Comprehensive manual testing checklist included

**AC4: Environment variables defined**
- **Given** the application requires configuration
- **When** all required env vars are documented
- **Then** `.env.local.example` exists with complete documentation
- **Status:** ✗ BLOCKED - Security hook prevented file creation (documented in Dev Notes)

**AC5: API route configured**
- **Given** Auth.js handlers exported from lib/auth.ts
- **When** route.ts imports and re-exports GET/POST handlers
- **Then** Auth.js handles all auth requests at /api/auth/*
- **Status:** ✓ PASS - Verified in app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts:1-4

**AC6: Custom login page**
- **Given** a user visits /login
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** they see Google OAuth button and email input with proper UX
- **Status:** ✓ PASS - Verified in app/(auth)/login/page.tsx (loading states, validation, error handling)

**AC7: Session accessibility**
- **Given** SessionProvider wraps the app
- **When** components need session data
- **Then** `auth()` works server-side, `useSession()` works client-side
- **Status:** ⚠ NOT VERIFIED - Requires runtime testing (pending manual test execution)

**Coverage Summary:** 5/7 fully verified, 1/7 blocked with workaround, 1/7 requires manual testing

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage:**
- Automated tests: 0% (none exist)
- Manual tests documented: 100% (comprehensive checklist)

**Test Strategy Compliance:**
Per `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`:
- ✓ Manual testing is **explicitly allowed** for 2-day MVP
- ✓ Comprehensive manual test checklist provided
- ✓ Strategy acknowledges automated tests are post-MVP

**Test Design Quality:**
- ✓ Manual checklist covers all critical paths
- ✓ Includes both happy paths and error scenarios
- ✓ Tests both Google OAuth and email magic link flows
- ✓ Verifies session persistence across page refreshes

**Critical Gap:** No tests executed yet - story status shows "Ready for Testing" but no testing performed

   - User must manually create file
   - Template provided in story Dev Notes
   - Impact: LOW (well-documented workaround)

2. Manual testing not performed
   - All verification tasks unchecked
   - Impact: HIGH (no validation of working system)
   - Blocker: Requires actual credentials

**Future (Optional):**
- Consider automated tests if development complexity increases

### Security Review

**No Issues Found**

**Findings:**
- JWT implementation follows Auth.js best practices
- Session cookies properly configured (httpOnly, secure in prod)
- No sensitive data exposure in client code
- Environment variable handling improved via refactoring
- Error messages are user-friendly without leaking system details
- Security posture appropriate for personal project with invited users

### Performance Considerations

**No Issues Found**

**Observations:**
- Minimal auth route overhead (direct proxy pattern)
- Client-side validation prevents unnecessary API calls
- No performance bottlenecks identified
- Loading states provide good UX during network latency

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA (Refactoring):**
- `lib/auth.ts` - Added environment variable validation function

**Action Required:** Dev should update File List section to include:
```
**Modified (QA Refactoring):**
- `lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced with environment variable validation
```
