# Story 1.4: Deploy to Vercel with Environment Variables

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to deploy the application to Vercel with all required environment variables configured,
**so that** authentication works in production and the app is accessible to users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Project connected to Vercel via GitHub/GitLab integration
2. All environment variables configured in Vercel project settings:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Email provider credentials
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` (production URL)
3. OAuth callback URLs configured in Google Cloud Console for production domain
4. Deployment successful with no build errors
5. Production site accessible at Vercel-provided URL
6. Authentication flow working end-to-end in production:
   - Google OAuth sign-in successful
   - Email magic link sign-in successful
   - Protected routes properly enforcing authentication

## Dev Notes

### Vercel Deployment Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, backend-architecture.md]

**Vercel Integration:**
- **CI/CD:** Automatic deployment on git push (main branch → production, other branches → preview)
- **Serverless Functions:** Next.js API routes automatically deployed as serverless functions
- **Edge Network:** Global CDN for static assets and Edge runtime functions
- **Environment Variables:** Managed via Vercel dashboard, encrypted at rest
- **Monitoring:** Built-in function logs and analytics

**Runtime Configurations:**
- `/api/chat` → Edge runtime (25s timeout, global distribution)
- `/api/auth/*` → Node runtime (10s timeout, OAuth handling)
- Middleware → Edge runtime (authentication checks)

### Environment Variables Strategy

**Production vs Development:**
```bash
# Local Development (.env.local - NOT committed to git)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=local_dev_secret_123
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=...
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=...
RESEND_API_KEY=...
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@buddahbot.local
NOUS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.nousresearch.com/v1
NOUS_API_KEY=...
HERMES_MODEL=Hermes-4-405B

# Production (Vercel Dashboard - NOT in git)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://buddah-bot-abc123.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<NEW_SECRET_FOR_PRODUCTION>
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=<SAME_AS_LOCAL>
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=<SAME_AS_LOCAL>
RESEND_API_KEY=<SAME_AS_LOCAL_OR_NEW>
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@buddahbot.com
NOUS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.nousresearch.com/v1
NOUS_API_KEY=<SAME_AS_LOCAL>
HERMES_MODEL=Hermes-4-405B
```

**Critical Security Notes:**
- **NEVER commit `.env.local` to git** (already in `.gitignore`)
- **Generate NEW `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for production** (don't reuse local)
- **Use Vercel dashboard for environment variables** (not in code)
- **Google OAuth credentials can be same for local and prod** (multiple redirect URIs supported)

### Google OAuth Multi-Environment Setup

**Authorized Redirect URIs (both needed):**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google        # Local development
https://buddah-bot-abc123.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google  # Production
```

**Why both:**
- Same OAuth client can have multiple redirect URIs
- No need for separate dev/prod OAuth apps
- Simplifies credential management

### Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deployment:**
- [ ] All code committed and pushed to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] `.env.local` NOT committed (verify in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] All environment variables documented in `.env.local.example`
- [ ] Google OAuth client has production callback URL added
- [ ] Resend API key valid and email domain verified

**During Deployment:**
- [ ] Vercel project created and connected to git repo
- [ ] All environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] Deployment logs checked for warnings

**Post-Deployment:**
- [ ] Production URL accessible
- [ ] Authentication flows tested (Google + email)
- [ ] Chat streaming tested with real message
- [ ] Protected routes enforce authentication
- [ ] Vercel function logs show no errors

### Vercel Dashboard Configuration

**Project Settings:**
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected)
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (default)
- **Output Directory:** `.next` (default)
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (default)
- **Node Version:** 18.x (default, sufficient for Next.js 15.5.4)

**Environment Variables Configuration:**
- **Scope:** Production (required), Preview (optional), Development (skip - use local)
- **Encryption:** Vercel encrypts all environment variables at rest
- **Access:** Only project members can view/edit

### Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

**Build Failures:**
- Check Vercel build logs for TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies in `package.json`
- Test local build: `npm run build` before deploying

**Authentication Issues:**
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches actual production URL
- Check Google OAuth callback URL includes production domain
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set (generate new for production)
- Check Vercel function logs for auth errors

**Streaming Issues:**
- Verify `NOUS_API_KEY` is valid and has credits
- Check Edge function timeout (25s limit)
- Monitor Vercel function logs for upstream API errors
- Test Nous API directly with curl to isolate issues

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- Verify all required variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Check variable names match code (typos common)
- Redeploy after updating environment variables (not applied to running deployment)

### Important Notes from Previous Stories

**Story 1.1 Completion Notes:**
- Project initialized with Next.js 15.5.4 and TypeScript
- Assistance UI configured
- Basic chat page exists

**Story 1.2 Completion Notes:**
- Auth.js configured with Google OAuth and email providers
- JWT sessions (no database required)
- Login page and auth error page created

**Story 1.3 Completion Notes:**
- Middleware protects all routes except public paths
- Chat API validates session
- Sign-out functionality implemented

**Integration Points:**
- All authentication flows depend on correct environment variables
- Google OAuth requires production callback URL configuration
- Email magic links require Resend (or SMTP) configuration
- Chat streaming requires valid Nous API key

### Testing Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing in Production:**

**Initial Deployment Verification:**
- [ ] Production URL loads (not 404 or 500 error)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid (https with green lock)
- [ ] Favicon and branding assets load
- [ ] `/login` page renders correctly
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors on load

**Authentication Flow Testing:**
- [ ] Google OAuth:
  - Click "Sign in with Google"
  - Complete consent screen
  - Redirected back to production site
  - Session created (check cookies in DevTools)
  - Chat interface accessible
- [ ] Email magic link:
  - Enter valid email address
  - Submit form
  - Receive email within 60 seconds
  - Click magic link in email
  - Redirected to production site
  - Session created
  - Chat interface accessible

**Protected Routes Testing:**
- [ ] Without session: Navigate to `/` → redirected to `/login`
- [ ] With session: Navigate to `/` → chat interface loads
- [ ] Sign out → redirected to `/login`
- [ ] Attempt to access `/` after sign-out → redirected to `/login`

**Chat Functionality Testing:**
- [ ] Send message: "Hello"
- [ ] Streaming response starts within 2 seconds
- [ ] Panel format displays (3 teachers)
- [ ] Full response completes without errors
- [ ] Response quality matches expectations
- [ ] Test message length limits (max 2000 chars)
- [ ] Test conversation history (if implemented)

**Edge Case Testing:**
- [ ] Test session expiration (wait 30 days or manually expire cookie)
- [ ] Test invalid OAuth callback (simulate by changing Google OAuth config)
- [ ] Test expired magic link (wait 24 hours or regenerate)
- [ ] Test network failures (disable internet during streaming)
- [ ] Test concurrent sessions (multiple tabs, multiple devices)

**Monitoring and Logs:**
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor function execution time (should be <25s for chat)
- [ ] Check for any rate limiting from Nous API
- [ ] Monitor email delivery success rate (Resend dashboard)

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Vercel Dashboard Metrics:**
- **Function Invocations:** Monitor `/api/chat` and `/api/auth` call volume
- **Execution Duration:** Ensure chat streaming completes within 25s Edge limit
- **Error Rate:** Should be <1% for normal operation
- **Build Status:** Track deployment success rate

**User Feedback Collection:**
- Share production URL with 3-5 initial users
- Request feedback on:
  - Authentication ease (Google vs email preference)
  - Chat response quality
  - Streaming speed
  - Overall user experience
- Document feedback for post-MVP iterations

**Known Limitations (Document for Users):**
- 25s Edge timeout (long responses may be truncated)
- Nous API rate limits (handle gracefully with error messages)
- Email delivery delays (magic links may take 1-2 minutes)
- No conversation history yet (coming in Epic 3)

### Next Steps After Deployment

**Immediate:**
- [ ] Share production URL with trusted circle (friends/family)
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for first 24 hours
- [ ] Address any critical issues discovered by early users

**Post-MVP (Future Epics):**
- Epic 2: Implement actual chat streaming with Nous API and panel mode prompts
- Epic 3: Add conversation history persistence (Vercel KV/Redis)
- Epic 4: Polish UI, add analytics, optimize performance
