# Story 2.4: Verify End-to-End Chat Flow in Production

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to have a working conversation with the spiritual panel,
**so that** I can receive multi-voice guidance on my questions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Full flow working: login → send message → receive streaming panel response
2. Panel response features exactly 3 spiritual teachers (per system prompt)
3. Response quality matches Nous Portal testing (conversational, multi-voice format)
4. Performance targets met:
   - Time-to-first-token < 2s
   - Complete response < 300s
5. Basic error handling verified (AI SDK handles automatically):
   - Network failure shows error message
   - Invalid API key shows error message
6. Multiple consecutive messages in same conversation working correctly
7. Production deployment successful with all environment variables configured

## Dev Notes

### End-to-End Flow Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md, backend-architecture.md]

**Complete Request Flow:**
```
1. User navigates to / → Middleware checks session
   ↓
2. If no session → Redirect to /login
   ↓
3. User signs in (Google/Email) → Auth.js creates JWT session
   ↓
4. Redirect to / → Chat interface loads
   ↓
5. User sends message → Assistance UI POST to /api/chat
   ↓
6. Edge function validates session
   ↓
7. Edge function validates request body (Zod)
   ↓
8. Edge function gets system prompt (panel mode)
   ↓
9. Edge function calls Nous API with system prompt + user messages
   ↓
10. Nous API streams SSE response
   ↓
11. Edge function pipes stream to client
   ↓
12. Assistance UI renders streaming tokens
   ↓
13. Stream completes → User sees full panel response
```

**Critical Integration Points:**
- Middleware → Session validation
- Auth.js → JWT session creation
- Assistance UI → Chat state management
- Edge function → Streaming proxy
- Nous API → Panel response generation

### Panel Format Verification
[Source: docs/prd/3-three-conversation-modes.md]

**Expected Panel Response Format:**

✅ **Correct Panel Response:**
```
**Eckhart Tolle:** The nature of suffering lies in our resistance to what is. When we identify with our thoughts and emotions, believing them to be who we are, we create an inner conflict that manifests as suffering.

**Tara Brach:** I would add that suffering often comes from a sense of separation - feeling cut off from our own hearts, from others, and from life itself. This trance of unworthiness creates a deep longing that can never be satisfied externally.

**Alan Watts:** Indeed, and what both Eckhart and Tara are pointing to is that suffering is fundamentally a misunderstanding. We suffer because we're trying to make permanent what is inherently impermanent, trying to grasp onto experiences that by their very nature are flowing and changing.
```

❌ **Incorrect Formats to Watch For:**
- Only 1-2 speakers (should be exactly 3)
- Bullet point lists instead of conversational paragraphs
- No interaction between speakers
- Generic advice instead of spiritual wisdom
- More than 3 speakers (prompt violation)

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Exactly 3 speakers present
- [ ] Speakers reference each other's ideas
- [ ] Conversational format (paragraphs, not lists)
- [ ] Spiritual depth (not generic self-help)
- [ ] Contrasting philosophies explored
- [ ] Natural integration of book references

### Performance Benchmarking
[Source: docs/prd/2-success-criteria.md]

**Performance Targets:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Acceptable Range |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Time-to-First-Token | < 2s | DevTools Network TTFB | 0.5s - 2s |
| Complete Response | < 300s | Full stream duration | 10s - 60s (typical) |
| Auth Flow | < 5s | Login → Chat load | 2s - 5s |
| Page Load | < 3s | First contentful paint | 1s - 3s |

**How to Measure:**

1. **Browser DevTools (Network Tab):**
   ```
   - Click message send
   - Find /api/chat request
   - Check "Time" column for TTFB
   - Check stream duration for total time
   ```

2. **Console Logging:**
   ```typescript
   // Added in previous stories
   console.log('[Stream] Request sent:', Date.now());
   console.log('[Stream] First token:', Date.now());
   ```

3. **Vercel Function Logs:**
   ```
   - Dashboard → Functions
   - Check execution duration
   - Verify most requests < 60s
   ```

**Performance Issues to Monitor:**
- Slow TTFB (> 2s) → Check Nous API latency
- Slow total time (> 60s) → Check response length
- Inconsistent performance → Check cold starts
- Timeouts (> 300s) → Reduce max_tokens or use 70B model

### Error Scenario Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md, Story 2.4]

**Error Test Matrix:**

| Error Type | How to Test | Expected Result | Verify |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Network Failure | DevTools → Offline | "Unable to connect..." | ✅ User-friendly message |
| Session Expired | Clear cookies | Redirect to /login | ✅ Auth required |
| Invalid Request | Send malformed JSON | 422 validation error | ✅ Clear error message |
| Rate Limit | Rapid requests (if triggered) | "Service temporarily busy..." | ✅ Retry message shown |
| Timeout | Wait for 300s+ (rare) | "Response taking too long..." | ✅ Timeout message |
| API Key Invalid | Break NOUS_API_KEY (dev only) | "Service unavailable" | ✅ Generic message to user, detailed log |

**Error Recovery Verification:**
- After error → Send new message → Should work
- Multiple errors → System still recoverable
- Error doesn't break chat state
- Assistance UI handles all errors gracefully

### Production Environment Configuration
[Source: docs/prd/6-configuration-environment-variables.md]

**Required Vercel Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Authentication (from Epic 1)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://buddha-bot.vercel.app  # Actual production URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<production_secret>          # NEW - don't reuse dev
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=<google_client_id>
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=<google_client_secret>
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_API_KEY=<resend_key>

# Nous API (Epic 2)
NOUS_API_BASE_URL=https://api.nousresearch.com/v1
NOUS_API_KEY=<nous_api_key>                  # From portal.nousresearch.com
HERMES_MODEL=Hermes-4-405B
BUDDHABOT_MODE=panel
```

**Environment Variable Checklist:**
- [ ] All variables set in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Production scope selected (not preview/dev)
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is NEW (not reused from dev)
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches actual Vercel URL
- [ ] `NOUS_API_KEY` has sufficient credits
- [ ] OAuth callback URLs updated in Google Console

**Google OAuth Production Setup:**
```
Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client
Add authorized redirect URI:
https://buddha-bot.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

### Multi-Message Conversation Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**Conversation Context:**
- Each request includes full message history
- Assistance UI manages message array client-side
- No conversation history persistence yet (Epic 3)
- Messages sent to Nous API: `[system, ...allUserAndAssistantMessages]`

**Test Conversation Flow:**
```
User: "What is the nature of suffering?"
→ Panel responds (3 teachers)

User: "How do I work with this in daily life?"
→ Panel builds on previous response

User: "Can you give a specific example?"
→ Panel references previous context
```

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Second response acknowledges first question
- [ ] Third response builds on conversation
- [ ] Teachers maintain consistency across messages
- [ ] Context not lost between messages
- [ ] Response quality remains high

**Limitations (MVP):**
- No conversation history persistence
- Refresh page → Context lost
- Max 20 messages per conversation (validation from Story 2.1)

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Browser Support Matrix:**

| Browser | Version | Streaming Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Chrome | 90+ | ✅ SSE native | Primary target |
| Safari | 14+ | ✅ SSE native | Test thoroughly |
| Firefox | 88+ | ✅ SSE native | Should work |
| Edge | 90+ | ✅ SSE native | Chromium-based |
| Mobile Safari | iOS 14+ | ✅ SSE native | Test on actual device |
| Mobile Chrome | Android 90+ | ✅ SSE native | Test on actual device |

**Known Issues:**
- Older Safari (< 14) may have SSE issues
- Mobile browsers may timeout on slow connections
- Background tabs may throttle streaming

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Desktop Chrome → Full flow works
- [ ] Desktop Safari → Full flow works
- [ ] Desktop Firefox → Full flow works
- [ ] Mobile Safari → Streaming works, UI responsive
- [ ] Mobile Chrome → Streaming works, UI responsive

### User Feedback Collection
[Source: docs/prd/2-success-criteria.md]
