# Story 3.2: Integrate AssistantCloud with Existing Chat Runtime

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my chat messages to be saved automatically,
**so that** I can refresh the page and see my conversation history.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/api/assistant-ui-token` endpoint created (Node runtime) that validates Auth.js session and returns AssistantCloud workspace token
2. AssistantCloud instance created in `app/assistant.tsx` with Auth.js session integration
3. `cloud` prop passed to `useChatRuntime` hook with `authToken` from `/api/assistant-ui-token` endpoint
4. Messages automatically persist to AssistantCloud after streaming
5. Page refresh loads previous conversation automatically
6. No manual save/load code required (handled by Assistance UI)
7. Thread ID managed automatically by AssistantCloud
8. First message in conversation auto-generates thread title
9. No errors in console related to cloud persistence

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create `/api/assistant-ui-token` endpoint (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create file: `app/api/assistant-ui-token/route.ts`
  - [ ] Add Node runtime export: `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`
  - [ ] Import Auth.js: `import { auth } from '@/auth'`
  - [ ] Validate session:
    ```typescript
    const session = await auth();
    if (!session?.user?.email) {
      return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Call AssistantCloud API to get workspace token:
    ```typescript
    const response = await fetch(
      `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL}/workspaces`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.ASSISTANT_API_KEY}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          userId: session.user.email, // Use email as stable user ID
        }),
      }
    );
    ```
  - [ ] Return workspace token:
    ```typescript
    const { token } = await response.json();
    return Response.json({ token });
    ```
  - [ ] Test endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/assistant-ui-token` (with valid session)

- [ ] Task 2: Import and configure AssistantCloud in app/assistant.tsx (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Add import: `import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/react"`
  - [ ] Create AssistantCloud instance before runtime:
    ```typescript
    const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
      baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL!,
      authToken: async () => {
        const res = await fetch('/api/assistant-ui-token');
        const { token } = await res.json();
        return token;
      },
    });
    ```
  - [ ] Pass `cloud` to `useChatRuntime` hook:
    ```typescript
    const runtime = useChatRuntime({
      api: "/api/chat",
      cloud, // Add this line
    });
    ```
  - [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors

- [ ] Task 3: Test automatic message persistence (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Run dev server: `npm run dev`
  - [ ] Open browser to http://localhost:3000
  - [ ] Send test message: "Hello, can you introduce yourself?"
  - [ ] Wait for streaming response to complete
  - [ ] Check browser console for any cloud-related errors
  - [ ] Refresh page (F5)
  - [ ] Verify message history restored
  - [ ] Send another message
  - [ ] Verify it appends to existing thread

- [ ] Task 4: Verify thread ID management (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
  - [ ] Check for AssistantCloud user ID (key managed by framework)
  - [ ] Send first message in new session
  - [ ] Verify thread ID appears in network requests
  - [ ] Verify thread ID persists across refreshes
  - [ ] Clear localStorage → Refresh → Verify new thread created

- [ ] Task 5: Test thread title generation (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Start new conversation (clear localStorage or use incognito)
  - [ ] Send message: "What is the nature of suffering?"
  - [ ] Wait for response
  - [ ] Check AssistantCloud dashboard (or wait for Story 3.3 ThreadList)
  - [ ] Verify thread title auto-generated from first message

- [ ] Task 6: Error handling and edge cases (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Test with network throttling (DevTools → Network → Slow 3G)
  - [ ] Verify messages still save after streaming
  - [ ] Test with AssistantCloud API temporarily down (disconnect network mid-save)
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation (streaming still works)
  - [ ] Check console for clear error messages (not cryptic failures)
  - [ ] Test localStorage unavailable (incognito + block storage)
  - [ ] Document expected behavior for each edge case

- [ ] Task 7: Remove temporary test code from Story 3.1
  - [ ] Delete `lib/assistantcloud-test.ts` (no longer needed)
  - [ ] Remove any console.log statements used for testing
  - [ ] Clean up comments
  - [ ] Verify no dead code remains

- [ ] Task 8: Update README with usage notes
  - [ ] Document that chat history now persists
  - [ ] Explain authenticated mode (cross-device sync with Google account)
  - [ ] Add note about conversations tied to Google account
  - [ ] Link to AssistantCloud dashboard for viewing all threads

## Dev Notes

### AssistantCloud Integration Pattern

[Source: Research Agent - Assistance UI Persistence Patterns]

**Complete Integration (Minimal Code):**

```typescript
// app/assistant.tsx
"use client";

import { AssistantRuntimeProvider, AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/react";
import { useChatRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";
import { Thread } from "@/components/assistant-ui/thread";

export const Assistant = () => {
  // Create cloud instance
  const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
    baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL!,
    authToken: async () => {
      const res = await fetch('/api/assistant-ui-token');
      const { token } = await res.json();
      return token;
    },
  });

  // Pass cloud to runtime - that's it!
  const runtime = useChatRuntime({
    api: "/api/chat",
    cloud, // Enables automatic persistence
  });

  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
      <Thread />
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
};
```

**What This Does:**
- Messages automatically save after streaming completes
- Thread IDs managed by AssistantCloud
- User ID from Auth.js session (email)
- Thread title auto-generated from first message
- History restored on page mount
- **Zero manual persistence code**

### Authenticated User ID from Auth.js

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**How Authenticated Mode Works:**
1. User signs in with Google OAuth (Epic 1)
2. Auth.js creates JWT session with user.email
3. `/api/assistant-ui-token` endpoint uses session.user.email as stable user ID
4. AssistantCloud workspace token tied to user's email
5. Same Google account = same threads across all devices
6. Sign out and sign in = threads restored

**Why Email as User ID:**
- Stable across sessions (never changes for Google account)
- Already validated by Google OAuth
- Natural unique identifier for "friends & family" users
- No manual localStorage management needed

### Automatic Thread Management

[Source: Research Agent Report]

**Thread Lifecycle:**
1. User sends first message
2. AssistantCloud creates new thread automatically
3. Thread title generated from first message content
4. Thread ID stored and associated with user
5. Subsequent messages append to same thread
6. Page refresh → Thread history loaded automatically

**No Manual Code Needed For:**
- Thread ID generation
- Thread creation
- Thread title generation
- Message save after streaming
- Message load on mount
- Thread switching (Story 3.3)

### Current Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**File Structure:**
```
app/
├── assistant.tsx        # UPDATE THIS FILE
│   └── Add AssistantCloud instance
│   └── Pass cloud to useChatRuntime
├── api/
│   └── chat/
│       └── route.ts     # NO CHANGES (streaming only)
└── page.tsx             # NO CHANGES
```

**What Changes:**
- `app/assistant.tsx` - Add 5 lines of code (cloud instance + prop)
- Nothing else changes

**What Stays the Same:**
- `/api/chat` route (no persistence code added)
- Nous API integration (unchanged)
- Streaming behavior (unchanged)
- Authentication (unchanged)

### Environment Variables

[Source: Story 3.1]

**Required Variables (Already Set):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL=https://proj-07vk51r3xtjc.assistant-api.com
ASSISTANT_API_KEY=<your_key_if_you_have_one>
```

**Usage in Code:**
```typescript
const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
  baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL!, // From Story 3.1
  anonymous: true,
});
```

**Note:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix makes this accessible in client code

### Testing Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing Protocol:**

**Happy Path:**
1. Fresh browser → Send message → Verify saves
2. Refresh (F5) → Verify restores
3. Send another message → Verify appends
4. Close tab → Reopen → Verify persists

**Edge Cases:**
1. Network throttling → Verify eventual consistency
2. Network disconnect → Verify streaming still works
3. localStorage disabled → Document behavior
4. Multiple tabs → Each has independent thread (expected)

**Performance Checks:**
- Message save shouldn't block UI
- Page load with history < 500ms
- No console errors during normal operation

### Important Notes from Previous Stories

**From Story 3.1 (AssistantCloud Setup):**
- Environment variables configured
- AssistantCloud account created
- Anonymous mode selected for MVP

**From Epic 2 (Chat Streaming):**
- `/api/chat` route streaming via AI SDK
- `useChatRuntime` hook already configured
- Nous API integration working
- No changes needed to streaming logic

**Integration Point:**
This story adds ONE prop (`cloud`) to existing `useChatRuntime` hook - that's the entire change.

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: "AssistantCloud is not defined"**
- Solution: Ensure `@assistant-ui/react` v0.11.10+ installed
- Check import: `import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/react"`

**Issue: "baseUrl is undefined"**
- Solution: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Restart dev server (env var changes require restart)

**Issue: "Messages not persisting"**
- Solution: Check browser console for cloud API errors
- Verify network requests to AssistantCloud API succeed
- Check AssistantCloud dashboard for rate limits/status

**Issue: "History not loading on refresh"**
- Solution: Check localStorage is enabled (not incognito)
- Verify AssistantCloud user ID exists in localStorage
- Check network tab for thread history requests

### Success Criteria Summary

**Story Complete When:**
- [ ] `cloud` prop added to `useChatRuntime`
- [ ] Messages persist after streaming
- [ ] Page refresh restores conversation
- [ ] Thread ID managed automatically
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Anonymous user ID in localStorage
- [ ] Thread title auto-generated

**Ready for Story 3.3 When:**
- Messages successfully persist across refreshes
- No blocking issues with cloud integration
- Baseline working for adding ThreadList UI
