## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15.5.4 with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.1.14 (CSS-first config, modern v4 rewrite)
- **UI Components:** Assistance UI 0.11.10 (pre-built chat components)
- **shadcn/ui:** Primitive UI components for buttons, avatars, etc.

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

└── ...

tailwind.config.ts               # Tailwind CSS config (extend theme here)
```

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Assistance UI components in `components/assistant-ui/` are meant to be customized
- shadcn/ui components in `components/ui/` should be added via CLI only (`npx shadcn@latest add [component]`)
- Global styles go in `app/globals.css`
- Page metadata (title, favicon) configured in `app/layout.tsx`

**Current Assistant Component Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
```typescript
// app/assistant.tsx
export const Assistant = () => {
  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
      <SidebarProvider>
        <div className="flex h-dvh w-full pr-0.5">
          <ThreadListSidebar />
          <SidebarInset>
            <header className="flex h-16 shrink-0 items-center gap-2 border-b px-4">
              <SidebarTrigger />
              <Separator orientation="vertical" className="mr-2 h-4" />
              <Breadcrumb>
                {/* BuddhaBot branding appears here */}
              </Breadcrumb>
            </header>
            <div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
              <Thread />
            </div>
          </SidebarInset>
        </div>
      </SidebarProvider>
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
};
```

**Styling Approach** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Custom CSS only when Tailwind is insufficient
- Keep it simple - this is a 2-day MVP
- Avoid overengineering

**Color Scheme Guidance (User Request)**
- User wants "nice fitting colour scheme for light mode so it's not all white"
- Spiritual/contemplative aesthetic required
- Suggested palette:
  - Backgrounds: Soft warm beige, sand, or cream tones
  - Accents: Muted sage green, soft purple, or deep teal
  - Text: Dark charcoal (readable but not harsh black)
  - Borders: Very light neutral gray

### Previous Story Context
No previous story for Epic 4. Epic 3 (Chat History Persistence) completed with AssistantCloud integration. All chat history and thread management functionality is working.

### Important Constraints
- **Philosophy:** Keep it simple, calm, and minimal (KISS principle)
- **No Over-engineering:** MVP aesthetic polish only
- **Responsive:** Must work on mobile (friends/family will use phones)
- **Accessibility:** Maintain readable contrast ratios

### Testing

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Manual Testing Only** for MVP (no automated tests yet)
- Focus on visual QA and cross-browser/device testing

**Manual Testing Checklist for This Story:**
- [ ] Favicon appears correctly in browser tab (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Page title displays "BuddhaBot - Spiritual Wisdom Guidance"
- [ ] Color scheme is calm and spiritual (not harsh white)
- [ ] Typography is clean and readable
- [ ] Header branding is visible and styled appropriately
- [ ] Thread container and message bubbles have calm styling
- [ ] Composer area is polished and consistent
- [ ] Loading states (skeleton, "Loading conversation...") match theme
- [ ] Mobile responsive:
  - Test on real iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome) devices if possible
  - Use Chrome DevTools responsive mode at minimum
  - Verify sidebar collapses and expands properly
  - Check touch targets are large enough (44x44px minimum)
  - Test both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] No distracting animations or excessive visual effects
- [ ] Dark mode defaults from Assistance UI are acceptable (or optionally enhance)

**Debugging Tools:**
- Browser DevTools for inspecting styles, responsive design, and color contrast
- WCAG contrast checker for accessibility validation
